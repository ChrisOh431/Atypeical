# Atypeical
A small typing test built for typists of all types. I really liked the Swift Charts I saw at WWDC22 + wanted to try it out.

## Features
* Beginner, Standard, and Coding modes.
  * Beginner has only nouns with no punctuation or capitalization.
  * Standard has capitals, punctuation, names, all the other good stuff that goes into writing.
  * Coding is the lexicon of Swift keywords and SwiftUI views.
* A [Swift Chart](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts) that provides a visual on how your WPM changed throughout the test.
* Simplified result details, with WPM + CPS + Accuracy.
* Post-test Word Log to see what words you couldn't write right.
